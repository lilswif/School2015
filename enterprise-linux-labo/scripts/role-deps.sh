# Install role dependencies
#
# ansible/roles contains all roles used by nodes managed in this
# project. Generic roles from Ansible Galaxy are stored in a directory
# with name "user.rolename". These directories are ignored by
# .gitignore and should be installed after cloning the project
# repository. That's what this script does...
#
# The script will search ansible/site.yml for roles assigned to hosts
# with names in the "user.role" form and will try to install them all.
# If possible, it will use Ansible Galaxy (on Linux), but if this is not
# available (e.g. on Windows), it will use Git to clone the latest version.
#
# Remark that this is a very crude technique and especially the Git fallback
# is very brittle. It will download HEAD, and not necessarily the latest
# release of the role. Additionally, the name of the repository is guessed,
# but if it does not exist, the script will fail.
#
# Using ansible-galaxy and a dependencies.yml file is the best method, but
# unavailable on Windows. This script is an effort to have a working
# alternative.
